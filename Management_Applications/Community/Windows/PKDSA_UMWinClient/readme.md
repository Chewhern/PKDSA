- Enabling people to know the potential logic behind **challenge and respond with digital signature"** and how to implement them.

# Version 0.0.2
- Added **TOR** to the application. 
- Added **Session's messenger user ID** as a form of **"Medium of conversation"** to address on data integrity issues but this addressing of data integrity
