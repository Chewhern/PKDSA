# AGPL Modifications or Derivative work

In AGPL or GPL, there's a section called AGPL modifications or derivative work. 

## Situation 1
If you use the project internally without any modifications, or bundle it with your system as an API or library without altering the source code, such use is not considered a modified work or derivative work. This means you do not need to release the source code under AGPL v3.

## Situation 2
If you use the project to provide a public subscription service, without modifying the source code, your use will be considered a modified work or derivative work. Under AGPL v3, this means you are required to make the source code available to the users of the service.
