I will be finding some time to talk solely on this project like how to install, run, customize to your own needs.

In the same time, I will also be informing you guys on what I know by either having comparison between passwords and digital signature
and what are the considerations,thoughts that people should have.

For the time being, you may not understand anything that I have written.

## Purposes
1. Allowing public to understand how public key authentication could be done on website or devices.
2. Allowing MySQL and PHPMyadmin developers to understand the logic behind public key authentication so that they could implement it into MySQL and PHPMyAdmin(Uncertain).
3. Serve as a platform for a passwordless authentication.
